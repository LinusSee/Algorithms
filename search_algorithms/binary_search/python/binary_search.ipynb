    "# Binary search\n",
    "Binary search is an algorithm to search for a value in a sorted array.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The idea is that you always check the middle element of your array and then have three possible cases:\n",
    "1. You already found the element. In that case you can stop searching\n",
    "2. The element you checked is lower than the one you are looking for. In that case the number you are looking for, <br> if it exists, must be in the upper half of the array\n",
    "3. The element you checked is higher than the one you are looking for. In that case the number you are looking for, <br> if it exists, must be in the lower half of the array\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the array must be sorted, otherwise you could not constrain it by looking at the middle value.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "These three steps are repeated for your current array (halving it with every step) until you either found the element or are at size 1 or less where you can say whether the subarray contains your value or not."
